## ‚öΩ Psychometric AI for Athlete Profiling  

A platform that analyzes **football players‚Äô personality traits and sentiments** using **psychometric AI techniques**.  
The system combines **sentiment analysis** with the **Big Five personality model** (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) to generate **player personality profiles**, helping clubs and coaches in recruitment and performance evaluation.

### üìå Background & Problem  
Modern football recruitment goes beyond physical performance ‚Äî **psychological factors** such as teamwork, emotional stability, and adaptability are equally critical.  
- Traditional scouting methods lacked **objective psychological insights**.  
- Personality and behavioral cues were hidden in **interviews, media interactions, and social content**.  

This project aimed to bridge the gap by **automating personality profiling** of athletes using **NLP and psychometric modeling**.  

---

### üéØ Objectives  
- Extract **personality insights** using the **Big Five model**.  
- Perform **sentiment analysis** on text from interviews, articles, and player statements.  
- Deliver a **psychological profiling API** to assist scouting/recruitment decisions.  
- Host and serve results via a scalable cloud infrastructure.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Approach  
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Collected text data from interviews, sports articles, and player-related media.  

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Used **NLTK** for tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.  

3. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Applied ML classifiers (scikit-learn) and deep learning models (Keras) to determine sentiment polarity.  

4. **Personality Profiling**  
   - Implemented **Big Five personality model** mapping using linguistic features.  

5. **Deployment**  
   - Packaged as a **Flask API** and deployed on **AWS servers** for scalable access.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **ML/NLP:** scikit-learn, NLTK  
- **Deep Learning:** Keras  
- **Backend:** Flask  
- **Cloud:** AWS servers  
- **Language:** Python 3.x  

---

### üìä Results & Impact  
- Generated **psychological insights** for player scouting reports.  
- Enabled **objective profiling** of athletes beyond physical stats.  
- Helped recruitment teams identify **team fit, leadership potential, and adaptability**.  

---

### üöÄ Future Enhancements  
- Integrate **transformer-based embeddings** (BERT, RoBERTa) for richer personality signals.  
- Add **real-time social media monitoring** for dynamic profiling.  
- Expand beyond football ‚Üí **general athlete profiling** across sports.  
- Combine with **performance stats** for a holistic player evaluation system.

### üìå Note  
This was completed as an **applied AI project** in sports analytics.  
Due to data restrictions, **only the conceptual design and workflow can be shared** here.
